零级智能：无交互作用

零级智能存在于任何不具有交互作用能力的物质中。

TODO一级智能：被动交互作用，没有思维能力。如各种基本粒子、分子、无机物、简单的有机物分子；

二级智能：简单应激反应

二级智能具有简单应激反应。不一定存在繁殖能力。

例子：病毒耗能、指令程序运作。

病毒不需要持续消耗能量，而是存储势能备用。运作过程、普通的受控按部就班的指令程序段。

三级智能：能够主动地做简单探索。但是对于个体而言，不具有思维能力。个体与个体间可以有简单交互，从而在个体不一定能意识得到的情况下，其整体形成一定的协作能力。

例子：细菌根据食物浓度分布探索迷宫。

四级智能：能够具有简单思维能力，例如多种感知、运动能力、分析能力、归纳、简单存储能力、情感能力，可以根据环境简单运用工具。

例子：乌鸦的智能行为。

五级智能：具有类人的思维能力，能够使用工具完成复杂行为。具有较高的抽象思维能力，高度的社会协作能力。

例子：进入文明阶段的智人表现出的智能行为。

> A golf ball that responses by ﬂying away when hit by a rod, is not an IS. Viruses, which have molecular but not cell-level structures, are not considered IS here. A programmed manufacturing line machine that can only do repeating movements is not an IS. We say that these systems exhibit no intelligence, i.e., Level-0 (L0) intelligence.
> 
> We assume the phenomenon of intelligence involves process of information, and sometimes physical actions. We propose the ﬁrst scope of of discussion as Level-1 (L1) IS:
> 
> Proposition 1: An intelligent system with Level-1 intelligence (IS-L1) is a system that meets all following 3 criteria:
> 
> (1) It is part of a bigger system with clear boundary.
> 
> (2) It has a goal.
> 
> (3) It is able to receive, process and output information in a way to beneﬁt the goal.
> 
> We call the bigger system as the ‘‘world’’ for the IS, which is consisted by two parts, the IS itself and the so-called ‘‘environment’’. We then deﬁne the second scope of discussion as Level-2 (L2) IS:
> 
> Proposition 2: An intelligent system with Level-2 intelligence (IS-L2) is a system that meets all following 3 criteria:
> 
> (1) It is an IS-L1.
> 
> (2) It is able to update itself towards better serving its goal.
> 
> (3) It has an informational representation of the world, which can simulate and predict certain aspects of the world.
> 
> We call the informational representation a ‘‘model’’, which is a ‘‘simpliﬁed world’’ that mimics certain aspects of the rules of the real world. Note that up to now, the IS can be pure informational in nature, e.g., a chatbot computer program can be an IS-L1 or IS-L2, the ‘‘world’’ for it can be the ocean of text information in its accessible database.

> The existence of information itself relies on physical reality, e.g., information encoded in a beam of electromagnetic wave relies on the substance of electromagnetic ﬁeld, information stored in computer ﬂash drive or showed on a screen relies on the status of electrons in semiconductor structures. Nevertheless, we further deﬁne the third scope of discussion as Level-3 (L3) IS:
> 
> Proposition 3: An intelligent system with Level-3 intelligence (IS-L3) is a system that meets all following 3 criteria:
> 
> (1) It is an IS-L2.
> 
> (2) It is able to abstract information from physical reality, and transfer information into physical actions.
> 
> (3) It is able to interact with the physical world.
> 
> In this context, an IS-L3 not only relies on physical substances, but also is able to conduct informational-physical conversions, and to interact with (and thus change) physical world. For instance, a human being, as a typical IS-L3, has his or her physical body and brain, and the information residing on them. The perception system converts physical reality into information, e.g., light scattered by an object is converted into electrical signal in optical nerve cells. The human informational IS, carried by the chemical and electrical signals in nerve system and brain, receives, processes and outputs information. The output information is converted into actions that allow the human to approach his or her goal. A face-recognition access control system can also be an IS-L3. It has hardware like the camera, computing and storage chips, screen, and electrically controlled door. It has software that includes the trained artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) inference program, door control program. The Is uses camera to capture the light scattered by an approaching person’s face, converts it into a picture as electrical signals, and outputs face recognition result (e.g., YES if the person is in the approved list). It then controls the door to open or stay closed, serving the goal as a door keeper. The ANN can represent the raw information of picture as simpliﬁed ‘‘features’’, and can update itself to increase accuracy as taking in more and more pictures.
> 
> Very interestingly, the IS-L3 itself, as part of the physical world, is also (potentially) represented in its own informational representation of the physical world. As deﬁned above, IS-L3 is both informational and physical, while it has an informational representation of the physical world. This gives rise to a lot of interesting properties of intelligent systems.
