  abstract = {Cognition is meant as the process of acquiring knowledge from the world. This process is supposed to happen within agents, which build such knowledge with the purpose to use it to determine their actions on the world. Following Peircean ideas, we postulate that such knowledge is encoded by means of signs. According to Peirce, signs are anything that can be used to represent anything else. Also, for Peirce, to represent means to be able to generate another sign, called the interpretant of the original sign, which still holds the same power of interpretability, I.e, its power to be transformed into a new sign, holding this same power. This happens through a process called semiosis, the process by which a sign is transformed into an interpretant. This whole process is performed with the aim of subsidizing the agent in deciding its behavior. So, even though the semiosis process has the power to continue infinitely, it usually stops whenever the generated interpretant brings enough information in order for the agent to effectively act in the world. We take signals to be the substract of signs. Signals are any physical property, which can be measured and captured by the agent, by means of its sensors. This includes any kind of internal memory the agent is able to have access, in order to operate. In this sense, signs can be both in the world (if these signals come from sensors) and within the own agent's mind (if signals come from an internal memory). We understand an agent's mind as the agents' control system. In either case, signals can be abstracted as numbers. Not simply numbers, but numbers coming from specific sensors or specific memories. Using ideas from Peircean philosophy, in this work we postulate a pathway, in which signals, collected by either sensors or memory, can be organized in such a way that they can be effectively used as knowledge, in order for an agent to be able to decide its actions on the world, on the pursuit of its internal motivations. We postulate that agents identify and create a model of the world based on possibilities, existents, and laws, and based on this model, they are able to decide an action that maximizes the chance for the world to gain a shape, which the agents intend for it to be. This theory is postulated particularly for the case of artificial autonomous agents, meant to be constructed by engineering artifacts.},

These models can be used to construct artificial intelligent agents to deal with several tasks in the real world. The introduction presents a specific scope of cognition that takes perception and action as two connected moments bound together by signs. Some key concepts related to Peircean categories and sign typology are presented, and they are used to demonstrate their connections to the three instances of the world of ideas: World of Sense, World of Things, and World of Categories. Sensors/Actuators are considered as the unique interface with the properties of the world (signals). They are the basic artificial devices in the process of sign representation that lead semiosis toward more developed signs and, consequently, more complex ideas. Finally, artificial cognition must allow agents to act in the world, and it occurs by means of the sign interpretant, mostly by the energetic interpretant.},

  abstract = {Building autonomous artificial agents able to grow open-ended repertoires of skills across their lives is one of the fundamental goals of AI. To that end, a promising developmental approach recommends the design of intrinsically motivated agents that learn new skills by generating and pursuing their own goals {\textemdash} autotelic agents. However, despite recent progress, existing algorithms still show serious limitations in terms of goal diversity, exploration, generalization or skill composition. This perspective calls for the immersion of autotelic agents into rich socio-cultural worlds, an immensely important attribute of our environment that is mostly omitted in modern AI, including deep reinforcement learning research. We focus on language especially, and how its structure and content may support the development of new cognitive functions in artificial agents, just like it does in humans. Indeed, most of our skills could not be learned in isolation. Formal education teaches us to reason systematically, books teach us history, and YouTube might teach us how to cook. Most importantly, our values, traditions, norms and most of our goals are cultural in essence. This knowledge, and some argue, some of our highest cognitive functions such as abstraction, compositional imagination or relational thinking, are formed through linguistic and cultural interactions with others. Inspired by the seminal work of the developmentalist Vygotsky, we suggest the design of Vygotskian autotelic agents able to interact with others and, more importantly, able to internalize these interactions within the agent so as to transform them into cognitive tools supporting the development of new cognitive functions. This perspective paper finds its inspiration in the work of psychologists and philosophers to propose a new AI paradigm in the quest for artificial lifelong skill discovery. It justifies the approach by uncovering several examples of new artificial cognitive functions emerging from interactions between language and embodiment in recent works at the intersection of deep reinforcement learning and natural language processing. Looking forward, it highlights future opportunities and challenges for Vygotskian Autotelic AI research.},

  abstract = {A standard approach in the simulation of language evolution is the use of Language Games to model communicative interactions between intelligent agents. Usually, in such language games, an agent uses the results from its perceptual layer to categorise and to conceptualize world objects, a process named categorization. In this paper, we develop an approach to the categorization process, where the decomposition of reality in meaningful experiences is co-evolved with the lexicon formation in the language game. This approach brings some insights on how meaning might be assigned to symbols, in a dynamic and continuously changing environment being experienced by an agent. In order to do that, we use Barsalou's notion of mental simulation and G{\textasciidieresis}ardenfors' notion of conceptual spaces such that, together with ESOM neural networks, a cognitive architecture can be developed, where mental concepts formation and lexicon formation are able to co-evolve during a language game. The performance of our cognitive architecture is evaluated and the results show that the architecture is able to fulfill its semantics function, by allowing a population of agents to exchange the meaning of linguistic symbols during a naming game, without relying on ``a priori'' categorization scheme provided by an external expert or a set of examples for training a neural network in a previous discrimination game. These results, beyond bringing evidence on potential ways for symbols to get meaning on a biologically realistic way, open a set of possibilities for further uses of conceptual spaces on a much more complex problem: the grounding of a grammatical language.},

Given an image, we first predict a probabilistic graph that represents its underlying semantics and serves as a structured world model. Then, we perform sequential reasoning over the graph, iteratively traversing its nodes to answer a given question or draw a new inference. In contrast to most neural architectures that are designed to closely interact with the raw sensory data, our model operates instead in an abstract latent space, by transforming both the visual and linguistic modalities into semantic concept-based representations, thereby achieving enhanced transparency and modularity. We evaluate our model on VQA-CP and GQA, two recent VQA datasets that involve compositionality, multi-step inference and diverse reasoning skills, achieving state-of-the-art results in both cases. We provide further experiments that illustrate the model's strong generalization capacity across multiple dimensions, including novel compositions of concepts, changes in the answer distribution, and unseen linguistic structures, demonstrating the qualities and efficacy of our approach.},

From their inceptions, these two notions have been essentially disconnected because each has defined its own language and tools. Here we demonstrate the existence of a deep conceptual link between (M,R) systems and Autopoietic systems. This relationship permits us to posit that Autopoietic systems, which have been advanced as capturing the central aspects of living systems, are a subset of (M,R) systems. This result, in conjunction with previous theorems proved by Rosen, can be used to outline a demonstration that the operation of Autopoietic systems cannot be simulated by Turing machines. This powerful result shows the potential of linking these two models. Finally, we suggest that the formalism of (M,R) systems could be used to model the circularity of metabolism.},

  abstract = {Having a rich multimodal inner language is an important component of human intelligence that enables several necessary core cognitive functions such as multimodal prediction, translation, and generation. Building upon the Conscious Turing Machine (CTM), a machine model for consciousness proposed by Blum and Blum [13], we describe the desiderata of a multimodal language called BRAINISH, comprising words, images, audio, and sensations combined in representations that the CTM's processors use to communicate with each other. We define the syntax and semantics of BRAINISH before operationalizing this language through the lens of multimodal artificial intelligence, a vibrant research area studying the computational tools necessary for processing and relating information from heterogeneous signals. Our general framework for learning BRAINISH involves designing (1) unimodal encoders to segment and represent unimodal data, (2) a coordinated representation space that relates and composes unimodal features to derive holistic meaning across multimodal inputs, and (3) decoders to map multimodal representations into predictions (for fusion) or raw data (for translation or generation). Through discussing how BRAINISH is crucial for communication and coordination in order to achieve consciousness in the CTM, and by implementing a simple version of BRAINISH and evaluating its capability of demonstrating intelligence on multimodal prediction and retrieval tasks on several real-world image, text, and audio datasets, we argue that such an inner language will be important for advances in machine models of intelligence and consciousness.},

  abstract = {This paper presents Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness 3.0, which incorporates several advances over previous formulations. IIT starts from phenomenological axioms: information says that each experience is specific {\textendash} it is what it is by how it differs from alternative experiences; integration says that it is unified {\textendash} irreducible to noninterdependent components; exclusion says that it has unique borders and a particular spatio-temporal grain. These axioms are formalized into postulates that prescribe how physical mechanisms, such as neurons or logic gates, must be configured to generate experience (phenomenology). The postulates are used to define intrinsic information as ``differences that make a difference'' within a system, and integrated information as information specified by a whole that cannot be reduced to that specified by its parts. By applying the postulates both at the level of individual mechanisms and at the level of systems of mechanisms, IIT arrives at an identity: an experience is a maximally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS, a constellation of concepts in qualia space), and the set of elements that generates it constitutes a complex. According to IIT, a MICS specifies the quality of an experience and integrated information WMax its quantity. From the theory follow several results, including: a system of mechanisms may condense into a major complex and non-overlapping minor complexes; the concepts that specify the quality of an experience are always about the complex itself and relate only indirectly to the external environment; anatomical connectivity influences complexes and associated MICS; a complex can generate a MICS even if its elements are inactive; simple systems can be minimally conscious; complicated systems can be unconscious; there can be true ``zombies'' {\textendash} unconscious feed-forward systems that are functionally equivalent to conscious complexes.},

  abstract = {Single units were recorded from the CA1 field of the hippocampus in the freely-moving rat. They were classified as place units, displace units or others. Place units were defined as those for which the rat's position on the maze was a necessary condition for maximal unit firing. Some of these place units (misplace units) fired maximally when the animal sniffed in a place, either because it found something new there or failed to find something which was usually there. Displace units increased their rates during behaviors associated with theta activity in the hippocampal slow waves. In general these were behaviors which changed the rat's position relative to the environment. The influence of various environmental manipulations (e.g., turning off the room lights) on the firing pattern of the place units was tested and the results suggest that they were not responding to a simple sensory stimulus nor to a specific motor behavior. Nor could the unit firing be due purely to motivational or incentive factors. The results are interpreted as strong support for the cognitive map theory of hippocampal function.},

  abstract = {This theoretical article examines how to construct human-like working memory and thought processes within a computer. There should be two working memory stores, one analogous to sustained firing in association cortex, and one analogous to synaptic potentiation in the cerebral cortex. These stores must be constantly updated with new representations that arise from either environmental stimulation or internal processing. They should be updated continuously, and in an iterative fashion, meaning that, in the next state, some items in the set of coactive items should always be retained. Thus, the set of concepts coactive in working memory will evolve gradually and incrementally over time. This makes each state is a revised iteration of the preceding state and causes successive states to overlap and blend with respect to the set of representations they contain. As new representations are added and old ones are subtracted, some remain active for several seconds over the course of these changes. This persistent activity, similar to that used in artificial recurrent neural networks, is used to spread activation energy throughout the global workspace to search for the next associative update. The result is a chain of associatively linked intermediate states that are capable of advancing toward a solution or goal. Iterative updating is conceptualized here as an information processing strategy, a computational and neurophysiological determinant of the stream of thought, and an algorithm for designing and programming artificial intelligence.},

These morphisms are a composition of a set of generators, each being specified by their relations with other generators, and therefore co-dependent.

  abstract = {We cast aspects of consciousness in axiomatic mathematical terms, using the graphical calculus of general process theories (a.k.a symmetric monoidal categories and Frobenius algebras therein). This calculus exploits the ontological neutrality of process theories. A toy example using the axiomatic calculus is given to show the power of this approach, recovering other aspects of conscious experience, such as external and internal subjective distinction, privacy or unread\- ability of personal subjective experience, and phenomenal unity, one of the main issues for sci\- entific studies of consciousness. In fact, these features naturally arise from the compositional nature of axiomatic calculus.},

  abstract = {In this Opinion article, we discuss how integrated information theory accounts for several aspects of the relationship between consciousness and the brain. Integrated information theory starts from the essential properties of phenomenal experience, from which it derives the requirements for the physical substrate of consciousness. It argues that the physical substrate of consciousness must be a maximum of intrinsic cause{\textendash}effect power and provides a means to determine, in principle, the quality and quantity of experience. The theory leads to some counterintuitive predictions and can be used to develop new tools for assessing consciousness in non-communicative patients.},
